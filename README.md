### Making word models

1. To make a word model from your messages you first need to [request your data](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692) from Discord
2. Extract the `messages` folder from the .zip file you receive after a few days
3. Create the model with the command `model create -f "</path/to/messages/folder>"`
4. Select what channels you want to include
5. When done, press  CTRL+S and enter a name for the model. This will be displayed in the command choices in Discord.
6. After that, finally enter a filename for the model
7. The model will be saved to the `models` directory at the program's root path


### Creating the Discord bot
1. Create a new application at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a [bot user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots) for the application
3. Generate a token for the bot & add this to the config file
4. Use a OAuth2 link with the bots' application ID, scope of `applications.commands bot` and permissions of `2048` to add the bot to the guild(s) you want


### Running the bot
Run the bot by using the command `bot run`.

Generate text using the `/generate-text` slash command.

## ‚úç Features planned

- CUI for managing bot
- Adding timed events for sending daily messages for example
- Make a model from individual messages.csv files
- More bot commands? Ideas are welcome

## ‚ùó Known issues
- Currently, the `LogLevel` and `ModelsToUse` config options do nothing
- The CUIs can crash the program if the terminal display is too small
- Backslashes can't be entered in the CUIs

## ‚ú® Credits
- Thanks to my Discord friends who gave me this dumb idea
- Also, this is also my first project that I have managed to do from start to finish, so any feedback on what I could do better is very much welcome!
