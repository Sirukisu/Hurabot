### Making word models

**IMPORTANT:** Note that anyone that has access to the bot can generate messages using your models, so only use the bot in private guilds and only include channels that don't have any sensitive messages.

1. To make a word model from your messages you first need to [request your data](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692) from Discord
2. Extract the `messages` folder from the .zip file you receive after a few days
3. Create the model with the command `model create -d "</path/to/messages/folder>"`
4. Select what channels you want to include
5. When done, press  CTRL+S and enter a name for the model. This will be displayed in the command choices in Discord.
6. After that, finally enter a filename for the model
7. The model will be saved to the `models` directory at the program's root path or to the path set in the `config.json` file


### Creating the Discord bot
1. Create a new application at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a [bot user](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots) for the application
3. Generate a token for the bot & add this to the config file
4. Use a OAuth2 link with the bots' application ID and the scope of `applications.commands bot` to add the bot to the guild(s) you want


### Running the bot
Run the bot by using the command `run`.

Generate text in Discord with the `/generate-text` slash command.

## ‚úç Features planned

- CUI for managing bot
- Adding timed events for sending daily messages for example
- Make a model from individual messages.csv files
- More bot commands? Ideas are welcome

## ‚ùó Known issues
- Currently, the `LogLevel` config option does nothing
- The CUIs can crash the program if the terminal display is too small
- Backslashes can't be entered in the CUIs
- CUIs can glitch a bit on Windows

## ‚ú® Credits
- Thanks to my Discord friends who gave me this dumb idea
- Also, this is also my first project that I have managed to do from start to finish, so any feedback on what I could do better is very much welcome!
